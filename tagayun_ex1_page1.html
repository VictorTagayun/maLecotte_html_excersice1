		<b>Mapúa University</b>, referred to as its acronym <abbr title="Mapúa University"><b>MU</b></abbr>, and formerly
		named <b>Mapúa Institute of Technology</b>, is a private, non-sectarian, research-oriented higher education
		institution founded in 1925 by the first registered Filipino architect, Tomás Mapúa. It is located in Intramuros,
		Manila and Makati.
		<br /><br />
		It is the Philippines' premier engineering and technological school and a top Asian University.

		The institute was founded on January 25, 1925, by Tomás B. Mapúa, a graduate of Cornell University
		and the first registered Filipino architect and Civil Engr. Gonzalo T. Vales. At first, the institute
		only offered architecture and civil engineering programs. It is the first educational institution
		in the Philippines to offer a bachelor's degree in architecture. When the school opened in 1925,
		there were 75 students and 15 faculty members. Classes were held in a rented commercial building
		in Carriedo Street near Feati University in Quiapo, Manila. In 1928, the Mapúa Institute of Technology
		Pre-Engineering High School was established in Doroteo Jose Street (now present site of Amaia Skies
		Tower Avenida developed by Ayala Group) through Rizal Avenue Sta. Cruz Manila. Then in 1930,
		Mapúa joined the National Collegiate Athletic Association as the Mapúa Cardinals.</p>
		
	<h2 id="late_dev" style="font-family:tahoma; color:#2F232E; margin-top:2%; margin-left:17%; margin-right:17%">World War II and After-War Development</h2>
	<p style="font-family:tahoma; color:#2F232E ;text-align:justify; margin-left:17%; margin-right:17%">
		During World War II, Mapúa's Manila Campus was used as a garrison by the Japanese forces during
		the occupation of Manila, and all classes and organizations were suspended. The Institute would
		continue to suffer throughout the war as the effort of the Institute to continue the studies of
		the students were suspended, and Senior students were forced to prematurely graduate.</p>
		
	<p style="font-family:tahoma; color:#2F232E ;text-align:justify; margin-left:17%; margin-right:17%">
		In 1945 the Institute suffered destruction during the liberation. As a part of the rehabilitation
		program, the former De Luxe Fashion School in Doroteo José has Leased Lot property for 50 years
		(1948-1998) and housed the high school department in 1948. In 1951, the Don Tomas B. Mapúa family
		acquired a piece of land from the La Corporación Fransicana, where the present Manila Campus stands.</p>
		
	<p style="font-family:tahoma; color:#2F232E ;text-align:justify; margin-left:17%; margin-right:17%">
		The campus opened in 1956, and the building construction was completed in 1963—all college programs
		under the deanship of Engr. Gonzalo T. Vales were transferred from the Doroteo José campus to the
		Manila Campus in 1973. Tomas B. Mapúa died on December 22, 1965, and his son Óscar Sr. took over
		the presidency until he died in 1998.</p>
		
	<p style="font-family:tahoma; color:#2F232E ;text-align:justify; margin-left:17%; margin-right:17%">
		When Oscar Mapúa Jr., grandson of Tomás B. Mapúa, took over the presidency of the school, he
		served his duties until December 1999 only. He was replaced by Reynaldo B. Vea as the Mapúa
		family sold the institute to the Yuchengco Group of Companies
		(<abbr title="Yuchengco Group of Companies">YGC</abbr>) headed by Alfonso T. Yuchengco. </p>
		
	<p style="font-family:tahoma; color:#2F232E ;text-align:justify; margin-left:17%; margin-right:17%">
		In 2002, the old <abbr title="Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation">RCBC</abbr> Building on
		Senator Gil Puyat Avenue in Makati was purchased and converted into the Mapúa Makati Campus,
		where the School of Information Technology was moved from the Manila Campus. A spin-off of the
		School of IT, the Mapúa IT Center, as the Makati Campus is named, was established. The
		<abbr title="Mapua Information Technology Cente">MITC</abbr> offers 2-year diploma programs
		that eventually lead into an associate degree ladderized to the bachelor's degree (4-year)
		IT courses of Mapúa.</p>
		
	<p style="font-family:tahoma; color:#2F232E ;text-align:justify; margin-left:17%; margin-right:17%">
		Starting in 2002, Mapúa, originally on a semestral system, adopted the quartem system.
		This academic system was intended to allow students to graduate faster (e.g., the original 5-year
		engineering programs could be taken in four years) and to focus on less, interrelated course
		subjects in an 11-week term.
		<br /><br />
		On the other hand, Mapúa High School was closed down in 2005 since it was operated in the red.
		Along with the establishment of the Malayan High School of Science and Malayan Colleges Laguna,
		the Administration intends to encompass all its educational institutions under the name Malayan Colleges,
		to be later pushed through to university status as is under the Vision 2020 initiative with
		Mapúa Institute of Technology as the College of Engineering.</p>
		
	<p style="font-family:tahoma; color:#2F232E ;text-align:justify; margin-left:17%; margin-right:17%">		
		On May 18, 2017, Mapúa Institute of Technology was formally granted University Status, per
		Commission en banc Resolution No. 379-2017, dated May 9, 2017, at the
		<abbr title="Commission on Higher Education">CHED</abbr> Auditorium in Diliman, Quezon City.
		<br /><br />
		On January 8, 2018, Yuchengco Group of Companies and Ayala Corporation, through a joint press
		statement, has announced the possible merger of their education arms, namely Ayala Education, Inc.
		and iPeople, Inc, with the iPeople, Inc. being the surviving entity. It has been stated that
		the potential merger will be finalized in the first quarter of 2018. This brings together
		<abbr title="Ayala Education, Inc.">AEI</abbr>'s <abbr title="Affordable Private Education Center">APEC</abbr>
		Schools, University of Nueva Caceres, National Teachers College, and iPeople's Malayan Education System,
		operating under the name Mapúa University and its subsidiaries, Malayan Colleges Laguna
		(<abbr title="Malayan Colleges Laguna">MCL</abbr>) and Malayan Colleges Mindanao
		(<abbr title="Malayan Colleges Mindanao">MCM</abbr>), a combined student population of over 60,000.</p>
		
	<p style="font-family:tahoma; color:#2F232E ;text-align:justify; margin-left:17%; margin-right:17%">
		On May 2, 2019, the merger between <abbr title="Ayala Corporation">AC</abbr> Education and
		iPeople was completed, with the Yuchengco Group of Companies owning 51.3% of iPeople and 
		Ayala Corporation with a 33.5% share of the said company.
		<br /><br />
		On August 1, 2021, the Mapúa Makati Campus at Gil Puyat Avenue closed for its relocated
		site at the former Bormaheco property along Vito Cruz Extension, which was acquired and
		converted by the Yuchengco Group in 2018.</p>
